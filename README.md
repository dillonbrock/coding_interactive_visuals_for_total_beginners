# Coding Interactive Visuals for Total Beginners

This is a collection of sketches that we have worked on or will be working on in the workshop. If you want to play around with any of these, you can copy and paste the code into a sketch of your own (unfortunately there's no easy way to download that we have found). Feel free to work off these sketches as a starting point for one of your projects, or just use them to remind yourself of what we worked on in class.
